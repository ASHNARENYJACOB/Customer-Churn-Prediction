# Customer Churn Prediction with CLTV-Based Segmentation

This project builds an end‑to‑end machine learning pipeline on a Telco customer churn dataset. 
It predicts which customers are at risk of churning and combines churn probability with Customer
Lifetime Value (CLTV) so that the business can focus retention efforts on profitable high‑risk 
customers.
